# ClipAI
### Copy, think, paste ðŸ“‹
This is a PC app that makes your copy-paste magical (ooo, aaah). Copy any text as you normally would, hit a special keyboard shortcut, and watch as AI transforms your text before you paste it.

_In slightly more technical terms, this is super lightweight, tray-based AI clipboard assistant powered by Google's Gemini Flash 2.0. It runs silently in the background, listens for a hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+C), and processes clipboard text via the API and then returns the response directly to your clipboard so you can paste it._


## Features
- Simple Hotkey Integration: Press Ctrl+Alt+C to process your clipboard text with Gemini AI
- Custom Preprompt: Add default instructions to every AI request
- Covert Mode: Run without notifications for sneaky business (>á´—â€¢)
- System Tray Integration: Runs discreetly in the background
- Easy Configuration: Simple interface to set up your API key and preferences

### Getting your free API key
Since Google's pretty lax with letting people use their AI APIs for "experimental development", it's quite easy to get an API key as long as you have a Google account.

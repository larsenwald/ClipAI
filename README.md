# ClipAI
### Copy, think, paste ðŸ“‹
This is a windows application. Super lightweight, tray-based AI clipboard assistant powered by Google's Gemini Flash 2.0. It runs silently in the background, listens for a hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+C), and processes clipboard text via the API and then returns the response directly to your clipboard so you can paste it.

### Getting your free API key
Since Google's quite lax with their AIs for "experimental development", it's quite easy to get an API key as long as you have a Google account.

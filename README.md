# ClipAI
### Copy, think, paste ðŸ“‹
This is a windows application. Super lightweight, tray-based AI clipboard assistant powered by Google's Gemini Flash 2.0. It runs silently in the background, listens for a hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+C), and processes clipboard text via the API and then returns the response directly to your clipboard so you can paste it.

### Download
Get the latest release [here](https://github.com/larsenwald/ClipAI/releases)

### How it works
1. Download the latest release and unpack the zip file
2. Launch the app
3. Enter your Gemini API key and submit
4. Press Ctrl+Alt+C to send clipboard text to AI
5. The response gets copied back to your clipboard

### Getting your free API key
Since Google's lax with letting people use their AI APIs for "experimental development", it's quite easy to get an API key as long as you have a Google account.
